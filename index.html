  <h3>Syed who?</h3>
  <p>Syed is game for breaking boundaries, building bridges, crossing oceans of irrelevance -- one breath and one word at a time.</p>
  A foot soldier on a mission and a movement to create a content universe envisaged by the Subject Matter Expert (SME).

<p>Technical writer strives:</p>
<ul>

<li>To remain committed to the SME</li>

<li>To establish the rules of the SME in the land of the SME</li>

<li>To clash with confusion, exterminate content gaps, and weed out any room for negative user experience </li>

<li>To reach out to the SME for a helping hand to complete the content universe</li>

<li>To capture all the scenarios with whatever level of knowledge possessed</li>

<li>To remain committed to address the complex issues faced by the society</li>

<li>To believe that burden does not go beyond his capacity and that there is no room for excuse </li>

<li>Starts barefoot, seeks help, and builds on the content, brick by brick</li>

<li>Takes whatever information she gets</li>

<li>Remains unmoved if most close the doors on the face </li>

<li>Appreciates if only few voices come forward for knowledge sharing </li>

<li>Believes that documentation is not an easy task</li>

<li>Does not spend time learning, but quickly shifts to end-to-end user journey </li>

<li>Believes that empty words are part of the problem</li>

<li>Does not believe in just desserts</li>

<li>Believes help cannot be extracted by force, but what comes voluntarily</li>

<li>This mission is not for few days, months, or years... it's eternal</li>

<li>Documents whatever has been gained knowledge of </li>

<li>Believes there is no ideal, sweet time for documentation </li>

<li>Keeps promise of comprehensive documentation and does not hesitate to seek help from SMEs at any time</li>

<li>Remains motivated</li>

<li>Starts early</li>

<li>Borrows thoughts from anyone involved</li>

<li>Turns losses into wins by putting trust in documentation</li>

<li>Believes that SMEs will remain firm and cooperative in their support to documentation</li>

<li>Believes she is not knowledgeful about the product she is documenting</li>

<li>Provides service that benefits people</li>

<li>Not for material or personal profit</li>

<li>Provides a sense of security through her brute force of competence</li>

<li>Considers people have the right to know the product like the back of their hand </li>

<li>Believes she is not the boss</li>

<li>Believes misinformation and information scarcity has no place</li>

<li>It is HER time and she is duty bound to listen to the SME</li>

<li>Her job is to make sure the SMEs are heard and respected</li>

<li>HER COMMITMENT IS TO LISTEN TO THE SME</li>

<li>THE SME IS RESPONSIBLE for the success or failure of the mission</li>

<li>Because the SME knows the rules and the regulations</li>

<li>Comes forward with new thoughts and ideas</li>

<li>Decries old methods and ideas</li>

<li>SHE is temporary, SME is forever </li>

<li>And she is not responsible for anything but clear communication</li>

<li>Because a product should neither be insulted nor feared, and it should be explored and used fully.</li> 

<li>Glaring content gaps lying in the open, and nobody can get away by burying their head in the sand.</li>
