<H1>Perils of a Naive Technical Writer</h1>
<p>Life of a technical writer is indeed an interesting one. But if you are one of those naive technical writers who is averse to planning your work for the current quarter let alone for the entire year, then the alarm bells are already ringing loud for you. </p>
<p>Let us see how the life of such a technical writer would look like:</p>
<h2>The journey from URA to NPA</h2>
<p>If you don’t stick your neck out and, if required, gate crash the planning meetings during the early days of project ideation, then you have already deemed yourself as an un-required asset (URA). Come the release and the spotlight is turned on you. In the blink of an eye, the product team will unload on you. The lightning of emails, leadership kept in the loop, shine light on how you have been the Achilles heel to the entire release process. And you are burned down in the shame of incompetency. Whether you deserve it or not. And no sooner than the release is done that the polling about team performance is done and the report card is out. Voila! You have been doomed as a non-performing asset (NPA).</p>
<h2>The journey from UC to UB</h2>
<p>You are a contract worker (technical writer still) having grip over the client’s product team like a new born lion cub over a full-grown Bison. Or, you are an employee surrounded by a product team that cares as much as a bear cares for bees. In both these situations, your journey starts from being pushed under the carpet (UC) at the beginning of the project execution marathon to being pushed under the bus (UB) at the time of release.</p>
<h2>The journey from CR to BR</h2>
<p>You are in control of the documentation. Complete control. You have had discussions, two meetings, with one of the developers or testers from the product team. You have verbally conveyed your requirements to your talisman in the four walls of the chat room (CR), MS Teams, and your talisman has spelled the charm by giving you a bit of whatever they know about the entire release plan. And then the D-day appears and you realize that your work is a drop in an ocean. That moment! You realize how the burning arrows piercing through the dimly lit moonlight tear apart whatever you have accomplished in the name of documentation. The board room (BR) writes a death sentence, while you think of the idiom tip of the iceberg that had transpired in that chat room.</p>
