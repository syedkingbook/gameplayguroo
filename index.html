  <h3>Syed who?</h3>
  <p>Syed is game for breaking boundaries, building bridges, crossing oceans of irrelevance -- one breath and one word at a time.</p>
  He is a foot soldier on a mission and a movement to create a content universe envisaged by the Subject Matter Expert (SME).

<p>Generally, a technical writer strives:</p>
<ul>

<li>to remain committed to the SME</li>

<li>to establish the rules of the SME in the land of the SME</li>

<li>to clash with confusion, exterminate content gaps, and weed out any room for negative user experience </li>

<li>to reach out to the SME for a helping hand to complete the content universe</li>

<li>to capture all the scenarios with whatever level of knowledge possessed</li>

<li>to remain committed to address the complex issues faced by the society</li>

<li>to believe that burden does not go beyond his capacity and that there is no room for excuse </li>

<li>to start barefoot, seek help, and build on the content, brick by brick</li>

<li>to absorb whatever information she gets</li>

<li>to remain unmoved if most SMEs and other sources close doors on her face </li>

<li>to appreciate even if only few voices come forward for knowledge sharing </li>

<li>to believe that documentation is not an easy task</li>

<li>to not spend excessive time learning about the product, but quickly shifts to end-to-end user journey </li>

<li>to believe that empty words are part of the problem</li>

<li>to not believe in just desserts</li>

<li>to believe help cannot be extracted by force, but what comes voluntarily</li>

<li>to believe that this mission is not for few days, months, or years... it's eternal</li>

<li>to document whatever knowledge has been gained</li>

<li>to believe that there is no ideal, sweet time for documentation </li>

<li>to keep promise of comprehensive documentation and does not hesitate to seek help from SMEs at any time</li>

<li>to remain motivated</li>

<li>to start documentation early</li>

<li>to borrow thoughts from anyone involved</li>

<li>to turn losses into wins by putting trust in documentation</li>

<li>to believe that SMEs will remain firm and cooperative in their support to documentation</li>

<li>to believe that she is not knowledgeful about the product she is documenting</li>

<li>to provide service that benefits people</li>

<li>Not for material or personal profit</li>

<li>to provide a sense of security through her brute force of competence</li>

<li>to consider that people have the right to know the product like the back of their hand </li>

<li>to believe that she is not the boss</li>

<li>to believe that misinformation and information scarcity has no place</li>

<li>to believe that it is HER time and she is duty bound to listen to the SME</li>

<li>to believe that her job is to make sure the SMEs are heard and respected</li>

<li>to believe that HER COMMITMENT IS TO LISTEN TO THE SME</li>

<li>to believe that the SME IS RESPONSIBLE for the success or failure of the mission</li>

<li>to believe that SME knows the rules and the regulations of using the product</li>

<li>to lead documentation with new thoughts and ideas</li>

<li>to decry old methods and ideas</li>

<li>to believe that SHE is temporary, but SME is forever </li>

<li>to remain responsible for anything but clear communication</li>

<li>to believe that a product should neither be insulted nor feared, and it should be explored and used fully.</li> 

<li>to spot content gaps lying in the open (Nobody can get away by burying their head in the sand.)</li>
